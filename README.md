## Description 
We're going to create a Pokemon Trading Cards show page. To achieve this, you'll use JS to dynamically create all the elements on the page! 

## Instructions 
- Use this template as the starting point => https://codesandbox.io/s/pokemon-trading-cards-template-rd5vq?from-embed=&file=/index.html 
- Download the folder, don't use CodeSandbox, it will not work properly. 
- Make sure you check and understand the data that is given to you! 
- Create a card using JS that represents a single pokemon, use the example image as a reference. You will also find an HTML example commented out in the index.html 
- Use the exact CSS classes you see in the example HTML to obtain the same style for each card 
- The cards should be nested inside <ul class="cards"></ul> 
- Use the official-artwork object key as the images for the card. The images are all inside of the sprites key, in each pokemon object 
- Render all the cards on the page that represents all the pokemons, recreating the same layout, using JS 

## Tips 
- Use functions to your advantage. Break each card into smaller parts, and think how you can turn them into functions. 
- Once you've got a card, think of a way to programmatically create all the others 
- Make sure you understand well the data structure before starting to create the cards 

## Challenge 
Add an extra section to each card that contains information about which games each pokemon appeared in. 

## Challenge 2 
See if you can find a way to toggle between the different images of each card! (this is a hard one! You might want to use google...);
